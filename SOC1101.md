<h3 id="memo-2">Memo 2</h3>
<p>According to Durkheim (1982), a social fact is “any way of acting, whether fixed or not, capable of exerting over the individual an external constraint”. For example, since babies are born, their parents are supposed to take care of them until they are of age. Children are also required to go to school for a certain number of years. These social facts.<br>
Mindful Skepticism: “to tolerate the uncertainty that comes with this openness” ( Schwalbe, 1998:66).<br>
“Being sociologically mindful” gives us curiosity, care and hope through knowing that the social world is a “social construction” (Schwalbe, 1998:67).</p>

<ul>
<li>Approaches to social research</li>
<li><strong>Deductive</strong> starts with a theory, forms a hypothesis, makes empirical observations, and then analyzes the data to confrim, reject, or modify the original theory
<ul>
<li>e.g.: Hout and Fischer use survey data to test hypotheses about why more Americans have no religion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Inductive</strong> starts with empirical observations and then works to form a theory
<ul>
<li>e.g. 1: Mitch Duneier spends time with homeless man selling magazines in New York…</li>
<li><em>can be quantitative</em></li>
<li>e.g. 2: Researchers working on a large survey design questions to measure Americans’ atitudes towards civil liberties.</li>

<p>Big questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is there a need for inequality? Does it help society function?</li>
<li>How and why are resources distributed unequally?</li>
<li>Is inequality necessary?</li>
</ul>
<p>Pyramids: hierarchy, suffering of the masses for the benefit of the few</p>
<ul>
<li>Is social inequality inevitable?<br>
90% yes</li>
</ul>
<p>Marx and Engels 1848</p>
<ul>
<li>“We find almost everywhere a complicated arrangement of society into various orders, a manifold gradation of social rank.” (Lemert 2013, 34)<br>
Social stratifiation</li>
<li>A system by which a society ranks groups of people in a <strong>hierarchy</strong>
<ul>
<li>More favored at top; less priviledged near bottom</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Basic systems of stratification across history:
<ul>
<li>Slavery</li>
<li>Caste</li>
<li>Class</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Why? The product of increasing manufacture power and accumulation of wealth</li>
<li>Access and distribution of a finite set of resources</li>
<li>Structured inequalities between groups that result in <strong>differential access to</strong> <ins>capital</ins> <strong>in the form of material or symbolic rewards</strong>
<ul>
<li>economic (money)</li>
<li>human (education)</li>
<li>social (networks)</li>
<li>physical (ability)</li>
<li>cultural (taste)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Does inequality serve a purpose?<br>
Is a just/good society an equal one?</p>
<ul>
<li>Davis and Moore 1945
<ul>
<li>Functionalist perspective: social position is determined by talent and skill</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tumin 1953
<ul>
<li>Conflict perspective: social position is determined by power, resource differentials and social structural factors</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Krueger 2003
<ul>
<li>strike a balance between pros &amp; cons</li>
<li>pros: <strong>drives motivation and innovation</strong> --functional: efficient, not enough resources, fill roles, rewards+motivation</li>
<li>cons: bad if unrelated to skill/ability (productivity)<br>
and if easily influenced by those in power</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What is social inequality?</p>
<ul>
<li>The <ins>unequal or uneven distribution …</ins></li>
</ul>
<p>Functionalist Perspective</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Inequality serves a purpose in society</strong></li>
<li>It is universal, occuring in all societies
<ul>
<li>necessary and inevitable, from the need for social order</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Stratifies system does:
<ul>
<li>Place people in the division of labor</li>
<li>motivate people to work hard in that position</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Placing people in roles-- some are more important, with fair competition: most talented fill in important positions</li>
<li>Differential rewards-- rewards based on social value, doctors more rewarded, more training</li>
<li>The result is equitable, to the extent of fair competition</li>
<li>ultimately benefits everyone by creating the most efficient, most productive society</li>
<li>argues: function, not is inherently fair</li>
</ul>
<p>Conflict Perspective</p>
<ul>
<li>Inequality results from a struggle between groups competing fo scarce resources</li>
<li>is ubiquitous, but this <strong>does not mean</strong> that it is inevitable or positively functional</li>
<li>Articulates several dysfunctions or negative consequences of inequality</li>
<li>Emphasizes the role of coercion and power in producing social order
<ul>
<li>competition is <strong>not</strong> fair</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>conflict over power and resources is inevitable
<ul>
<li>produces unequal rewards, not functional importance</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
